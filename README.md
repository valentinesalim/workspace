Remote working conditions have become commonplace in today’s workplace. And with this kind of shift, it is more urgent than ever for organizations to leverage the best online collaboration tools to keep their teams on the same page at all times. However, online collaboration has its own drawback, the ability to jump in and out for endless tabs in your browser with different apps could be difficult for some people.

## What it does

**Work.space** is a one-stop solution for that hassle. We simulate the real world's workspace and allow you to become more productive by providing you with all the necessary tools needed. We believe that collaboration and transparency are two key components of the modern workplace experience. That's why we built **Work.space**, this could be an alternative to making virtual spaces more interactive, effective and at the same time more accessible for everyone of all ages.
